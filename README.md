# 🤟 ASL-NN-Project: Deep Learning for American Sign Language Recognition

Welcome to our graduation project repository, where we tackle **American Sign Language (ASL) recognition** using powerful deep learning models. Our goal is to develop a robust neural network-based system to classify ASL hand signs accurately.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and comparing various deep learning architectures for **image classification** of ASL gestures. We trained and evaluated models using a labeled ASL image dataset and performed extensive analysis to determine the best-performing architecture.

We also developed a **mobile application** that uses the trained MobileNet model to recognize ASL gestures in real-time using the device camera. The app predicts the detected alphabet along with the **confidence percentage**.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

We experimented with multiple deep learning models, including:

- ✅ **CNN from scratch**
- ✅ **VGG16**
- ✅ **ResNet**
- ✅ **DenseNet**
- ✅ **MobileNet** *(used in the mobile app)*

Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated using a structured pipeline. Performance metrics and visualization results were used to assess their effectiveness.

## 📱 Mobile Application (ASL Detector)

We built a mobile app that:

- Captures ASL gestures using the device’s **camera**
- Uses a **MobileNet** model to predict the corresponding **ASL alphabet**
- Displays the **confidence score** for each prediction in real-time

The app is lightweight and optimized for mobile inference using TensorFlow Lite.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated our models using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Loss and Accuracy Curves**
